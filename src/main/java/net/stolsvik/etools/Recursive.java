/**
 * A tool to prevent "stack explosions" when doing recursive calls, typically by calculating something like
 * <code>double sum() { return this.getValue() + <b>parent.sum()</b>; }</code>. If there is a massive parent chain,
 * the java stack will explode. This tool lets you define the recursion and the calculation in two separate
 * closures, so that the tool then can invoke them in an iterative fashion.
 * <p/>
 * It will by default provide automatic caching/memoization when employing {@link #recurse(Function, Supplier)}.
 * Note that to get memoization, you need to put an instance of this class as state on each of your instances in the
 * parent-chain, i.e. define it as a private field of the "node" class, and then provide a getter for the value,
 * i.e. <code>double sum() { return this.recurser.get(); }</code>.
 * Here's a "Node" that utilizes this class (employed in the JUnit test):
 * <pre>
 * private static class Node {
 *     private Long _value = (long) (Math.random() * 1_000_000);
 *
 *     Node _parentNode;
 *
 *     private Recursive<Long> _recursive = Recursive.recurse(
 *                    parentSum -> _value + parentSum
 *                    () -> _parentNode == null ? Recursive.stop(0L) : _parentNode._recursive);
 *
 *     long getRecursiveSum() {
 *         return _recursive.get();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * When researching the problem and solutions for Java, I assumed that this was an instance of "tail recursion".
 * However, it probably isn't, since you change object on which invoke "the same" method on (i.e. 'this' changes), even
 * though the call is at the very end.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the value that will be calculated and returned by {@link #get()}.
